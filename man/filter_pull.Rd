\usage{
filter_pull(
  data,
  data_type = "samples",
  standard_filtering = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of pulled data created by the \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}, \code{\link[=pull_bio]{pull_bio()}},
\code{\link[=pull_haul]{pull_haul()}}, or \link{pull_biological_samples}.}

\item{data_type}{Character string to include within data filtering messages
to indicate the type of data being filtered such as "biological samples".
Default is "samples".}

\item{standard_filtering}{A logical TRUE/FALSE that specifies whether data
should be filtered using the standard filtering which removes tows with bad
performance (water haul or poor net performance), or stations that have been
removed from the survey sampling protocol.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Function to create messages on data that are outside the standard survey protocol
and to remove these samples if \code{standard_filtering} = TRUE. The data are checked
for tow performance, valid stations, and depth range. This function is called
within the pull functions, but can be called on pulled data frames if filtering
was not selected in the original data pull.
